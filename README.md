# scripts-ssh
My extensions to ssh - use SSH as transport layer in many ways

### get
Download files from external server

### put
Upload files to external server

## ssh-auto-add-key

My wrapper for ssh - start [keychain](https://github.com/lhost/keychain) automatically, load SSH key for server and start ssh client. If everything works, you are logged in using SSH key and key is remembered in ssh-agent.
